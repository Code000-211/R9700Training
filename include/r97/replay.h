// r97/replay.h -- the residual stream at every layer boundary, and one layer re-run from it.
//
// The forward of the backward keeps only the residual at the layer boundaries: boundary 0 is what
// the embeddings wrote, boundary `i` is block `i-1`'s output, and a trunk of L layers has L+1 of
// them. A layer replay copies one boundary back into the step's residual buffer, restores the
// state the first forward started from, and re-issues exactly that block's ops, so the backward
// can take one layer at a time without holding every activation.
//
// A block's input state is the residual -- and, for the blocks that read one more boundary-
// sized buffer before writing it, that buffer too. In the qwen35 int8 trunk (qwen35_fp8) every
// block after the first does: its first norm is a fused add that reads the previous block's
// output and the residual and writes their sum. The plan says which boundaries carry that second
// copy (ResidualPlan::extra, one entry per boundary), and the store keeps it beside the
// residual; restore() puts both back before the block re-runs, so a replayed layer reads exactly
// what the forward's layer read, in either order. The first block and the whole bf16 trunk need
// no second copy.
//
// The replay is a training path: it reads the block brackets and the issue observer that
// patches/training/0101 adds to radiance, and the replay block that 0102 adds; an architecture
// must honour that block (qwen35_bf16 does). A serving build applies neither patch, so there is no
// replay there rather than one that would issue the whole model. A build that leaves 0102 out has
// the observer and the brackets but no replay, so the tests that need it skip by name.
